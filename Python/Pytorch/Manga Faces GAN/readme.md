# DCGAN Manga Face Generator

This project is based in the DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) architecture.
The project consists on a manga face generator.

The architecture consists on a Face generator and a Discriminator, playing a minimax game and optimizing each iteration.

In this model can be found a gan model as well, but this model was deprecated as the architecture shows a tendence to collapse.

On this project the original was extented from to 610 images to improve the performance.

There is a video showing all the iterations as well.
